***How it works:***

This app dosen't use a p2p connection or any private servers hosted by me. It takes all the links from established streaming sites by downloading the sites and extracting the useful information.

CloudSteam and Cloudsteam 2 works in diffrent ways. CloudSteam gets the links and info from the link site directly. Cloudsteam 2 will first search IMDb and then crossreference with the link sites and MAL to get the links. This will result in CloudSteam 2 having fewer providers overall, and sometimes having links to diffrent movies or shows with the same name. It will also make CloudSteam 2 slower because it has to download many more sites to get all the information.
